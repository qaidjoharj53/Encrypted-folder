# Encrypted-folder

This repo includes a python source code file that will do the following :-

1. It will create a folder containing 11,110 folders in it.
2. These folders are nested in each 10 folders 4 times.
3. Think of a password of 4 numbers.
4. Just input that password by clicking the folder number shown inside the main folder.
5. This will take you to the directory where your password meets.
6. Now just save your files you want to be encrypted in it.

NOTE : These saved files could be more secured if you just hide the main folder with subfolders.
